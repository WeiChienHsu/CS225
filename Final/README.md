## Unit 3: Induction and Recursion 

```
 Weak and Strong Induction
```

### Weak Induction
A proof by mathematical induction has two
parts, a basis step, where we show that P(1) is true, and an inductive step, where we show that for all positive
integers k, if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1 ) is true.

### Strong Induction
Similar with a proof by mathematical induction, a
strong induction also has two parts, a basis step, and an inductive step. 

The basis step of strong induction is the same with mathematical induction, where we show that P (1) is true. Differently, in the inductive step, we show that if P
(j) is true for all positive integers not exceeding k, then P (k + 1) is true.

```
 Recursive Definitions and Structural Inductions
```
### Structural Inductions
We use two steps to define a function with
the set of nonnegative integers as its domain:

BASIS STEP: Specify the value of the function at zero.

RECURSIVE STEP: Give a rule for finding its value at an integer from its values at smaller integers. 

Such a definition is called a recursive or inductive definition.

However, instead of using mathematical induction directly to prove results about recursively defined sets, we can
use a more convenient form of induction known as structural induction. 

#### Structural induction Steps

A proof by structural induction consists of two parts. These parts are:

BASIS STEP: Show that the result holds for all elements specified in the basis step of the recursive definition to be
in the set.

RECURSIVE STEP: Show that if the statement is true for each of the elements used to construct new elements in
the recursive step of the definition, the result holds for these new elements.
