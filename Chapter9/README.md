# Basic Counting Rules

## Counting Problem
Specifies a set of objects with certain properties and asks how many such objects there are.

Break problem down into simpler problems via counting rules:
- Product Rule
- Sum Rule

### Product Rule
Suppose that each element to be counted can be described by a sequence of k choices, where the jth choice is the selection of an element from finite set Aj.

The totla number of elements is |A1| * |A2| * |Ak|

#### Example
Desinger can choose from:
- 5 diff styles = {style1, style2, style3...}
- 6 diff color = {color1, color2, color3...}
- 3 diff luxury = {luxury1, luxury2...}
Count the number of posibile designs:

5 * 3 * 6


### Sum Rule
