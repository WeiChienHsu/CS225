# Graph
A graph is a collection of vertices (Nodes) connected by edges (arcs)
A common abstract data type in CS.

## Simple Graph
A simple graph with no 'self loops' and at most one edge between an two vertices.

Formally a graph G is a specified by a pair(V, E) where V is a finite set of vertices and E is a set of edges. Each edge species a pair of vertices that it connects.

V = {a, b, c, d, e}
E = {(a,b), (b,c), (c,e), (e,b)} -> Oreder is not matter
